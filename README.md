In order to delineate an organ of interest for volumetric or morphological study using multiplanar computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation is the process. Liver is the organ which has different pathology such as fat, iron deposits etc.
To segment it there are different methods. The Manual segmentation is the "gold standard" in clinical treatment and research, despite being difficult and time-consuming. Although increasingly automated segmentation systems are more resilient, they are nevertheless susceptible to a number of segmentation issues.  In this Project we are using GAN  this process helps us to create images.Segmentation now has two additional applications: surgical planning and integration with MRI-based biomarkers.
Because the liver is surrounded by blood vessels and organs, segmentation is a difficult problem. The most acceptable methods are CT scans and MRI scans. The liver transplantation needs correct liver volumetry repeatedly performance of this should be achieved. Because the liver tissues and other soft tissues are the same, it is difficult to observe them in CT scans because they have uneven grey scales and do not depict the correct image. To overcome this limitation, many deep learning techniques were introduced, GAN being one of them. Using this method, we will attempt to obtain a valid reference, accuracy, and efficiency.
